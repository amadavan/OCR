# OCR
This project is an attempt to create optical character recognition algorithms using various machine-learning techniques. The purpose of the project is to help develop better coding practices and to implement algorithms I have learned to further my understanding.

## Getting Started
The following sections will help you get this project up and running on your local machine.

### Dependencies
The following libraries were used for the development of this project:

- [Armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net/)
- [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/)
- [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest)
- [OpenBLAS](http://www.openblas.net/) \(optional\)

## Motivation
The goal of this project is to help develop my skills as a programmer and provide an opportunity to further my understanding of several machine learning algorithms that I have studied.

For the purpose of developing my programming skills I hope to improve in the following areas:

- Style
- Documentation
- Testing

The following machine learning algorithms are the ones I wish to develop:

- Nearest-Neighbor
- c-Nearest-Neighbor
- k-Nearest-Neighbor
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-means
- Expectation-Maximization (EM)
- Feed-Forward Neural Network
- Recurrent Neural Network
